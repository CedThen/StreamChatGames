# StreamChatGames

For streamers with a lot of downtime waiting for queues to pop, or that want to interact with their chat in a different way.

Play madlibs with your twitch chat! Select a story, and let your twitch chat fill in the blanks. The top 10 inputs will be displayed on the right,
and at the end of the timer the most repeated option will be saved. At the end, enjoy the content that you and your chat has created!

Frontend built with React and Three.js, backend built with Node, Express, websocket server, and twitch.tv's api
